###### Imagine being on a TV game show in the 1970s called *Let's Make A Deal*. The game show host, in a sporting gray chequered suit, shows you, the contestent, three doors on the stage. You are informed that behind one of these doors is a shining sports car, which will be yours. Behind the other two are...goats. 
###### If you choose the right door, you get to keep the shiny sports car. If you choose the wrong door...well, you *could* take the goat home (provided you don't live in a flat, in which case it would be awkward) - they are noble creatures after all.
###### Let's say that you choose door number one, because the human brain tends to favour linearity. Rather than opening that door, however, the host - who knows what's behind the doors - elects to open door number three instead. Behind the third door is one of the goats. The host then says to you, "Do you want to pick door number two?" At which point you ask yourself: is it to your advantage to switch to door number two as your chosen door? Or should you stay with door number one, your original choice?
###### This conundrum is known as The Monty Hall problem - a probability puzzle, which has been poured over by statisticans and mathmaticians. The puzzle was essentially solved by Marilyn vos Savant, an American magazine columnist with the highest recorded intelligence quotient in the *Guinness Book of Records*. Vos Savant observed that the contestent would be correct in switching doors, because this would mean a $^\frac{2}{3}$ (or 66.6666666etc%) probability of uncovering the door with the car, compared with only a $^\frac{1}{3}$ (or 33.3333333etc%) probability if the contestent stayed with the original choice of door.
###### When the contestant first makes their choice, there is a $^\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the car is behind one of the unchosen doors. This probability does not change after the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors. When the host provides information about the two unchosen doors (revealing that one of them, door number three, does not have the car behind it), the $^\frac{2}{3}$ chance of the car being behind one of the unchosen doors rests on the unchosen and unrevealed door - door number two - as opposed to the $^\frac{1}{3}$ chance of the car being behind the door that the contestent chose initially (door number one). 
###### This confounding logic has led to the problem gaining a lot of mathmatical equations and statistical analysis, such as in the images below:
