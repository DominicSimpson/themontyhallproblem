# The Monty Hall Problem

###### Imagine being on a TV game show in the 1970s. The game show host, in a sporting gold suit, shows you, the contestent, three doors on the stage. You are informed that behind one of these doors is a shining sports car, which will be yours. Behind the other two are goats (nothing wrong with that - goats are noble creatures). 
###### If you choose the right door, you get to keep the shiny sports car. If you choose the wrong door...well, you *could* take the goat home (provided you don't live in a flat, in which case it would be awkward).
###### Let's say that you choose door number one, because the human brain tends to favour linearity. Rather than opening that door, however, the host - who knows what's behind the doors - elects to open door number three instead. Behind the third door is one of the goats. The host then says to you, "Do you want to pick door number two?" At which point you ask yourself: is it to your advantage to switch to door number two as your chosen door? Or should you stay with door number one?
###### This conundrum is known as The Monty Hall problem - a probability puzzle, which has been poured over by statisticans and mathmaticians. The puzzle was essentially solved by Marilyn vos Savant, an American magazine columnist with the highest recorded intelligence quotient in the *Guinness Book of Records*. Vos Savant observed that the contestent would be correct in switching doors, because this would mean a $^\frac{2}{3}$ (or 66.6666666etc%) chance of uncovering the door with the car, compared with only a $^\frac{1}{3}$ (or 33.3333333etc%) chance if the contestent stayed with the original choice of door.
