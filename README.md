# The Monty Hall Problem

###### Imagine a TV game show in the 1970s. The game show host, in a sporting gold suit, shows you, the contestent, three doors on the stage. You are informed that behind one of these doors is a shining sports car, which will be yours. Behind the other two are goats (nothing wrong with that - goats are noble creatures). 
###### If you choose the right door, you get to keep the shiny sports car. If you choose the wrong door...well, you *could* take the goat home (provided you don't live in a flat, in which case it would be awkward).
###### Let's say that you choose door number one, because the human brain tends to favour linearity. Rather than opening tha door, however, the host - who knows what's behind the doors - opens door number three instead. He opens the third door. Behind the third door is one of the goats. The host then says to you, "Do you want to pick door number two?" Is it to your advantage to switch to door number two as your chosen door?
###### This conundrum is known as The Monty Hall problem - a probability puzzle, which has been poured over by statisticans and mathmaticians.
